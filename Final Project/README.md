# Final Project Manual Testing - ITFactory Course

The scope of my final project is to understand the new concepts better, to use all the knowledge gained so far throught the Manual Testing ITFactory Course and to apply them in practice, using a live application.

The application that I used for the testing process: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/

The related API documentation can be found here: https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/

The final project has two distinct sections: **Testing section** and **SQL section**.

The tools I used for this project: JIRA, Zephyr Squad, Postman, MySQL Workbench.
